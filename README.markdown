Total Transport
===============

Requirements
------------

* Ruby 2.3.4
* Postgresql 9.0 +

Installation
------------

Clone the repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:wearefuturegov/total_transport.git
```

Run `bundle install`

Copy the contents of `.env.example` to `.env` and replace the dummy variables with real ones

Run `bundle exec rake db:create`, then `bundle exec rake db:migrate` to set up the database

Run the tests with `bundle exec rake`

If you don't already have any data in the database, run `bundle exec rake admin:create` and follow the onscreen prompts to set up an admin user.

You can also set up a bunch of new routes, stops and landmarks by running `rake db:seed`

Spin up the server with `bundle exec rails server` and login to the admin interface at `http://localhost:3000/admin` to start adding routes.

Overview
-------

You can find a [model relation diagram here](./docs/erd.png), which can help get and keep your mind around the structure of the application.

A `Route` is a collection of stops, which are polygons on a map, which in turn have a `Place` (which usually refers to a town or village). A `Journey` is an instance of that route which happens at a particular time. A `Journey` can do the route forwards or in reverse. A `Journey` will have a `Vehicle`, which knows how many seats that vehicle had, and a `Supplier` who is the driver of the vehicle.

A `Booking` will definitely have a `Journey`, a `Passenger`, a pickup and a dropoff `Stop` (which is the polygon) and a lat/long of where exactly in that polygon the passenger wants to be picked up/dropped off. The lat/long can either be a predefined `Landmark` of that `Stop`, or a manually selected lat/long.

User Accounts
-------------

Suppliers and Passengers use two completely separate auth systems. Suppliers use a standard Devise setup, whereas Passngers use a custom written auth system using Twilio to auth via SMS code.

Reverse Journeys, return bookings
---------------------------------

Probably the most confusing thing about this application is the fact that a journey can do a route in either direction, and a passenger can book a return journey. This gets extra confusing when the two combine. A passenger can book an outward journey which is a route in reverse, but then a return journey which is forwards? Yeah, I know. Just remember: Journeys can be *reversed*, bookings can have a *return* journey.

Timings
-------

To try and keep things flexible during development and not allowing confusing database state from happening, the only datetime stored in the database is a `Journey`'s `start_time`. Everything else, including a booking pickup time and dropoff time is calculated from there in ruby. Each stop has how many minutes it roughly takes to drive from the previous stop (remember: this can be reversed), and this is presented to the passenger as within a 10 minute window.

This keeps things simple in the model layer, but can make doing DB queries based on times a bit difficult/impossible.

Misc
----

The `Booking` model calculates the price, based on number of passengers, distance, promo codes and discounts (bus passes and children)

As routes will be managed centrally (something I *strongly* suggest stays in the future, headaches will ensue otherwise), we have various places where both passengers and suppliers can manually suggest changes to the routes. That's what the \*\_suggestions models and controllers do.

`Supplier` does not necessarily mean Driver. A supplier can be a driver, but it can also be dispatcher or manager of a cab company. The creator of a journey on the system might not be the same person who drives it. Suppliers are grouped, along with the vehicles they own, in `Team`s, and can edit each others vehicles and journeys.
