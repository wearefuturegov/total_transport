# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.

      info: "The Operator aims to provide services as advertised on our website but there may be occasions when journeys take longer than expected and/or services may need to be diverted or cancelled due to factors beyond our control. These factors may include, without limitation, traffic congestion, road traffic accidents, road works, road closures, major events, adverse weather conditions or other unforeseen operating circumstances."

Where a service operates as ‘Hail and Ride’ or as non-DRT service in part, Customers holding a valid pass or valid pre-paid ticket have no priority over other fare paying Customers if they haven’t already booked to travel."

      title: "Getting on & off the vehicle"
      info: "You may only get on or off the vehicle at designated stops or stopping points on the specific route on which travel is taking place.  Where a ‘hail and ride’ scheme operates, you may only get on or off, on request, at places considered safe by the driver."
      info_2: "You should indicate clearly to the driver of an approaching vehicle if you wish to get on the vehicle. You must be at the specified location and give such indication in sufficient time to enable the driver to stop safely. In all other circumstances we accept no responsibility if the driver does not stop or permit you to board the vehicle."

      info_5: "You must not use the emergency exits on any vehicle except in a genuine emergency or where instructed to do so by the driver."
      info_6: "When you wish to get off the vehicle, please ring the bell once or say loudly as appropriate to alert the driver. For your comfort and safety, please give the driver sufficient time to be able to slow down properly for your stop. For your own and others’ safety, you are requested to remain seated until the vehicle comes to a complete stop. Visually impaired customers should advise the driver on boarding the bus, of their aligning point."
      info_7: "Save in exceptional circumstances, the driver is not permitted to allow passengers to get on or off when the vehicle is in motion, held up in traffic or stationary at traffic lights.  At bus stations and stands, passengers cannot be picked up once the driver has signalled his intention for the vehicle to leave the stand."

      info_4: "Unless otherwise stated, payment of fares must be made in cash Sterling. We do not accept on-bus payment by cheque or by £50 note in any circumstances. Where change is given, drivers may also not have sufficient change for other bank notes at certain times."
      info_5: "Other than when payment by contactless payment card (or similar technology) is available on-bus, we do not accept on-bus payment by credit or debit card except where this is locally advertised.  Payments by credit or debit card can only be made online at time of booking."
      info_6: "To help our Operator to run services smoothly the correct fare is always appreciated. The drivers will provide change if they are able to do so."
      info_7: "A valid ticket, valid pass or validated ‘smart’ card/device must be available for inspection for the entire journey and produced on request by the driver or a Company official. If you are unable to produce a valid ticket, valid pass or validated ‘smart’ card/device for fare for the journey being taken, up to the value of the Standard Fare. We will not refund you this fare if you later find the missing ticket or travel pass."
      info_8: "When you complete the journey you have paid for, or the validity of your pass or other relevant documentation expires either by time or travel zone, you must leave the bus or pay another fare to continue your journey. This will be treated as a separate journey. It is your responsibility to have a valid ticket for the whole journey."
      info_9: "Single or return fares may be calculated with reference to either boarding and alighting location or fare stages applicable to the route. Where fare stages are applied, if you get on between two fare stage boundaries you will be charged from the previous stage.  If you get off between two fare stage boundaries you will be charged to the following stage. If you are travelling in areas where zonal fares apply, your fare will be determined by the number of zones travelled in or through."
      info_10: "You may not break your journey when travelling on a single or return ticket unless our publicity specifically advises that this is possible. Except where it is specifically stated to the contrary, tickets, passes or other relevant documentation are not transferable. You cannot use a multi-journey ticket (e.g. travel card) for more than one person during the same journey."
      info_11: "You must only buy tickets from the website or from the driver. Not all tickets are necessarily available for purchase from the driver.  Buying a pre-paid ticket from anyone else invalidates the ticket, which may be withheld by the Operator and not returned for further use."
      info_12: "Unless specifically part of your Ride journey, if you transfer from another Operator's vehicle to one of our vehicles, you will be considered to be starting a new journey. You will be required to pay the appropriate fare if you do not hold, or are unable to produce on request, a valid pass, valid pre-paid ticket or valid through ticket."
      info_13: "If the Operator ticket equipment is not functioning properly and as a consequence is not able to produce tickets, you must still pay the correct fare for your journey."

      info_14_c: "expired: or"
      info_14_d: "in the reasonable opinion of the driver or an Operator official, been obtained fraudulently."
      info_15: "Customers are responsible for the safety and integrity of their own tickets and passes once validly issued. We are not obliged to replace your ticket, pass or permit to travel if it is lost, mislaid or stolen. You will have to purchase a new ticket to allow you to use our services."
      info_16: "If your ticket has been damaged but remains legible then the Operator may provide you with a replacement for the remainder of its period of validity, or offer you the choice to purchase a replacement ticket from their own range which may be valid for a longer period, but will require you to pay the difference if you choose this option."
      info_17: "Concessionary travel schemes for many categories of passenger are operated by local authorities in England, the Scottish Government and the Welsh Assembly. The terms, rules and conditions applying to these schemes are the responsibility of, and the validity of individual passes is determined by, the pass issuing authority."
      info_18: "The scheme validity times of travel are defined by the Travel Concession Authority within which the Customer boards the service.  The times are available from the Travel Concession Authority upon request."
      info_19: "Ride and it’s services are not always required to accept Concessionary Passes.  If a service does not accept a Concessionary Pass, this will be made clear on the website.  Where this is the case, a Pass Holder will be required to make a full payment for their journey."
      info_20: "Concessionary passengers must comply with all aspects of these Conditions, in addition to the issuing authority’s rules and conditions. Where required locally to do so, when making a journey using a concessionary travel pass you must advise the driver of your intended destination."
      info_21: "If you hold a valid concessionary permit or pass that is accepted on a Ride service, you must show it to the driver every time you get on one of our vehicles and, where required to do so, you must present the pass to the on-board ticket equipment to ensure its validity. In some areas, you will be issued by the driver with a zero-value ticket when making such a journey, and you must retain this for the duration of your journey. Where applicable, your concessionary permit or pass will not be considered valid if the ticket equipment does not recognise it to be so."
      info_22: "Where a concessionary travel pass permits the pass holder to be accompanied by a companion, one companion shall be carried without payment of a fare or at the appropriate concessionary fare as specified by the pass issuing authority and subject to its conditions for the use of the pass. A companion must get off the bus at the same bus stop as the concessionary pass holder (or any prior bus stop) or must have or purchase a valid ticket for any further travel beyond that bus stop unless a specific exemption applies. Any concessionary pass holder observed soliciting other passengers to offer them a free or reduced price journey shall have their pass details reported to the pass issuing authority."
      info_23: "Where we have reasonable grounds for suspecting that a concessionary pass is being misused in any way, we reserve the right to pass the details of the pass holder on to the issuing authority and/or refuse further travel and/or withdraw the pass, as appropriate."
      info_24: "For some journeys, you may buy a return ticket. Return tickets are valid only on the day of purchase, unless clearly advertised otherwise, and may have time restrictions on their validity (e.g. only available at off peak times). It is your responsibility to check the validity conditions of a return ticket. Return tickets should be purchased from the driver of the bus on the outward journey and presented to the driver of the bus on the return journey for validation. Unless otherwise advertised, return tickets are only valid for one single journey in each direction (i.e. not for two journeys in the same direction). Return tickets are not transferable."
      info_25: "On some routes, return tickets and passes may be valid on the services of another Operator and/or other Operators' return tickets and passes may be valid for travel on our services. This only applies where advertised locally and subject to any specific local conditions."
      info_26: "Ride or the Operator’s may offer a range of discounted tickets to suit customers’ needs for variable periods of travel."
      info_27: "These tickets, and any passes, permits and tickets issued by us, other Operators or other issuing authorities are accepted by us subject to their conditions of issue and use. Where the use of a ticket requires the presentation of an accompanying photographic identification card, we will not accept the ticket as valid for travel unless you also present that accompanying photographic identification card."
      info_28: "If misuse or fraud is suspected, a Customer may be asked for proof of identity and his/her ticket or pass may be withdrawn. In addition, Ride or the Operator may charge the value of any period of misuse. No refund will be made in respect of any outstanding value in the withdrawn ticket or pass."
      info_29: "Up to two children under five years old will be carried free-of-charge provided that they do not occupy a seat required by an adult passenger and are accompanied by a fare-paying Customer who is responsible for them. Additional children, or children under five occupying a seat required by an adult, may be charged as if they were aged five or over."
      info_30: "Individuals who are unable to provide proof of their age and/or student status on request from the driver or an Operator official may be required to pay the applicable adult fare. Any valid documentation bearing a photograph of the Customer including valid proof of age ID cards (available free of charge in many areas), will be accepted in these circumstances."
      info_31: "Children aged under 16 and those people who, in the reasonable opinion of the driver, are vulnerable, at risk or in distress, and are unable to pay their fare will be carried at all times. They may be asked to provide their name and address in order that the fare due could be collected at a later date. In these circumstances, the driver will issue a single ticket for one journey allowing the individual to travel to their home or the nearest stop thereto."

Signage on the vehicle will make clear where there is a designated buggy/scooter space. Operators cannot accommodate wheelchairs or mobility scooters on vehicles that do not have the appropriate facilities."
      info_3: "Operators cannot carry wheelchairs or mobility scooters which, combined with the weight of the occupant, are heavier than the safe working limit of the wheelchair ramp (in general, the safe working limit is 300kg of total weight although the driver will always have the discretion to evaluate and determine whether the maximum weight limit is likely to be exceeded in the circumstances)."
      info_4: "The Operator drivers are required (and trained) to provide reasonable assistance to wheelchair users or disabled Customers. Inconsiderate car parking or other factors may prevent the vehicle from being positioned sufficiently close to the kerb to allow a wheelchair user to get on or off safely. In this case the driver will try to identify a safe place to pull in as close to the bus stop as possible."
      info_5: "It is the Customer’s responsibility to ensure that their wheelchair, mobility scooter, pram or pushchair is safely positioned within the designated area and that they adhere to any notices applicable to that area and ensure that it does not obstruct or block any exit or gangway."
      info_6: "In the unlikely event that your wheelchair or other mobility equipment or assistive device is damaged or lost as a result of our negligence during the course of the journey, the Operator is responsible to provide compensation up to the cost of repair or replacement in accordance with EU Regulation 181/2011."
      info_7: "Wheelchair users have priority over everyone else for the use of the designated wheelchair space, since this is the only place in which they can travel safely. Non-wheelchair users, unlike wheelchair users, will normally have a choice about which part of the bus to sit or stand in. Common decency and respect for wheelchair users should mean that Customers without disabilities make way for them wherever reasonable to do so. Customers are required to offer reasonable cooperation in allowing proper use of the designated wheelchair area. If someone in a wheelchair wishes to get on and there is space elsewhere on the vehicle, Customers will be required by the driver to vacate the space provided it is reasonable for them to do so, including repositioning small prams or mobility scooters where possible and folding any buggies and storing these in the luggage space where available. However, no-one already travelling will be asked to get off the bus in order to accommodate a wheelchair user."
      info_8: "The dimensions of the wheelchair space permit the carriage of a wheelchair no longer than 1200mm and no wider than 700mm (the dimensions of a standard ‘reference’ wheelchair as specified in the Public Service Vehicle Accessibility Regulations 2000)."
      info_9: "An Operator is not required to accept a Mobility Scooter."
      info_10: "At an Operators discretion, the Operator will accept Class 2 mobility scooters (as designated by the Department for Transport) provided the mobility scooter does not exceed 1000mm long and 600mm wide with a maximum turning circle of 1200mm, and can be restrained within the vehicle using a “tie down” or clamp method."
      info_11: "Only folding pushchairs can be accommodated on services. Large buggies and prams will only be accommodated by some Operators. When not occupied by a wheelchair or mobility scooter user, the wheelchair space on most vehicles can accommodate up to two small prams or normal-sized unfolded pushchairs. Some vehicles also have additional pushchair capacity in a dedicated ‘buggy area’. The driver will be able to tell you where a pushchair or pram can be safety accommodated. You should follow their instructions."
      info_12: "Empty pushchairs or pushchairs carrying luggage must be folded and accommodated in appropriate luggage areas where safe to do so and with consideration for other Customers and their belongings. Ride or Operators will not accept liability for loss of or damage to pushchairs and prams."

      info_3: "If you are in breach of any of these Conditions (or the general law) you will be asked to give your name and address to an Operator official and may be removed from the vehicle or premises by an Operator official, a police officer or a community support officer and refused further travel without refund. We also reserve the right to take any other measures we consider necessary to protect the safety and comfort of our Customers and staff including temporarily or permanently banning you from travelling with Ride following an incident of misconduct."
      info_4: "Whilst we will do everything that we reasonably can to control the conduct of other Customers on Ride services, we cannot be held responsible for their conduct."
    section_9:
      title: "Luggage"
      info: "Where permitted, luggage is carried free of charge at the driver's discretion. In the interests of safety, availability and for the comfort of all our Customers, we reserve the right to refuse or restrict the size, amount and type of luggage or other belongings that you can bring on the Operator vehicles. In particular, the driver may refuse to accept any item being brought onto the vehicle and/or may refuse travel to any passenger if he/she believes that:"
      info_a: "there is insufficient space available for carriage of your luggage and/or you are carrying excessive amounts of luggage (to be determined at the driver’s discretion);"

You will be liable for any damage caused to the vehicle or other Customer’s belongings due to spillage or leakage of any liquid or substance carried."
      info_8: "Folding bicycles are permitted on board at the discretion of the Operator, provided that they are stowed safely and that they do not block the aisles or access to seats. While the Operator will make every effort to carry folding bicycles, there are instances when this may not be possible, including:"

A customer must advise when booking that an Assistance Animal will be accompanying the customer to ensure the vehicle can accommodate them both."
      info_2: "Except in the case of a registered disabled person, or trainer, accompanied by an Assistance Dog or other assistance animal, dogs will not be accepted  by all Operators and for those that do, only one dog or small animal may be carried per Customer (at the driver’s discretion) if the Customer advises Ride when making the booking."

      info_4: "When comments or complaints are about matters outside of Ride's control, we reserve the right to forward them to the relevant organisation and explain that we have done this."
